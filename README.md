Checklist:
1. Binary tree to post order linked list 
2. Insert invertors post order
    2.1 Find locations of invertors
    2.2 Insert invertors into post order linked list 
3. Preorder check parity of each sink nodes and if parity is odd, turn one bottom-most invertor into a buffer
4. Run zero_skew_adjust to find zero skew violations and adjust invertors accordingly
    4.1 How do we change the size of invertors to satisfy zero-skew requirements
